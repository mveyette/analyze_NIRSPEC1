# analyze_NIRSPEC1
A couple scripts to measure Teff, \[Fe/H\], and \[Ti/Fe\] of an M dwarf from a NIRSPEC-1 spectrum.
See [Veyette et al. (2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171010259V) for more info.

See the example.py file for an example of how to run this code.

NOTE: This code produces no quality assurance diagnostics. It should not be used blindly, but rather serve as a working example. You should double check that the throughput calibration, wavelength calibration, psuedo-continuum placement are reasonable before accepting any results of this code.
